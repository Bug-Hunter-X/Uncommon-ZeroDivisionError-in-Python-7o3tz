This repository demonstrates a subtle ZeroDivisionError in Python that might be missed during initial code review. The `function_with_uncommon_error` is designed to return 'a' if 'b' is zero, 'b' if 'a' is zero, otherwise it returns a/b. The error occurs when both 'a' and 'b' are simultaneously zero leading to an unhandled exception. The solution demonstrates how to improve the function to safely handle this edge case by explicitly adding a check for both 'a' and 'b' being zero.
